        Welcome to Smart Presence. The objective of this application is to detect your presence in target building and derive the building occupancy profile to help with
    your smart building management. In general, we provide three methods for you to choose: WiFi based method, positioning based method and manual method. \n \n
        WiFi based: the app will periodically compare the SSID (WiFi name) and BSSID (a unique ID assigned by the router) of your current WiFi connection with the target
    one configured by you so that you will be considered as being present if the they match. As a result, the app can derive the period of you staying or leaving the target
    building. \n \n
        Positioning based: the concept is that you will be considered as presence if you are within a certain range around the target building. In particular, the app can
    either periodically update your location with latitude and longitude to check your presence, which costs more battery or passively listen the location updates from other
    apps to trigger a geofence, which is less energy consumed. \n \n
        Manual method: you simply need to click the shortcuts provided by the app to check in or out anytime you entering or leaving the target building. It totally relies on
    your habits. \n \n
        We strongly suggest that before starting the services, go to setting page in which you can deal with your account, change the interval between two detections, change
    for what period during a day the service should work, determine whether to receive daily notification or not and change language. \n \n
        Finally, the app will work in the background and your data will be upload and stored in firestore database for further analysis.

    <string name="huawei_description">Huawei: even if you have disabled the battery optimization from the app, you still need to do it in your system setting page. Moreover,
    for older version of Huawei devices, the app works not perfectly due to intrinsic property of its customized Android system which significantly limit the background
    services, thus, please turn on the daily notification and re-start the service everyday or when you wakeup in the morning. However, for later version, due to the
    restriction of Google, the positioning based method does not work due to the fact that Google play service no longer supports Huawei.</string>
    <string name="samsung_description">Samsung: it does put some restrictions on background service so that please turn on the daily notification. On the other hand,
    you still need to manually grant the permission to run background service.</string>
    <string name="onePlus_description">OnePlus: you have to manually disable to battery optimization which cannot be stopped in the app for onePlus.</string>

        In order to utilize the WiFi connection to detect user\'s presence, you need to follow several steps: \n \n
        1. Go to the configuration page by clicking the three dots on right-top corner. \n \n
        2. In the configuration page, you can generate SSID and BSSID of your current WiFi connection or manually input them (in such case, please make sure you are right!!!).
        You also need to decide the address which can be inputted manually or selected from a map. At last, you need to define what is the maximum occupancy of target building. \n \n
        3. Click on right-top corner to save your configuration and then come back to this page. \n \n
        4. Click "START" to start the service and then the service will run in the background automatically according to your settings. \n \n
        5. You can click "STOP" to terminate the service. The "START" button will become "RESTART" after clicking "START" so that you can restart your service whenever you want. \n \n
        6. Additionally, you can also click "SHOW WORKING STATUS" to check current service condition (ENQUEUED: the service is waiting in the line for the next detection;
        RUNNING: the service is running and performing the detection; CANCELLED: the service has been terminated by you; NOTHING: you have not define any service).

        In order to utilize the Google positioning service to detect user\'s presence, you need to follow several steps: \n \n
        1. Go to the configuration page by clicking the three dots on right-top corner. \n \n
        2. In the configuration page, you need the address and location (latitude and longitude) of target building, which can be inputted manually (in such case, please
        make sure the inputs are right!!!) or selected from a map. Moreover, you need to define what is the maximum occupancy of target building. At last, you can also choose to whether
        to disable battery saving mode or not. If you stick to default one without battery saving, the app will update location by itself periodically, which may cost more
        battery. On the other hand, if you change to battery saving mode, you won\'t have significant battery drop, however, the accuracy of detection is not good since the app
        will refer to so-called geofence which totally relies on the location update from other apps. We suggest that you can turn on the battery saving mode only when you
        often use apps which will require location service, e.g. Google Map. \n \n
        3. Click on right-top corner to save your configuration and then come back to this page. \n \n
        4. Click "START" to start the service and then the service will run in the background automatically according to your settings. \n \n
        5. You can click "STOP" to terminate the service. The "START" button will become "RESTART" after clicking "START" so that you can restart your service whenever you want. \n \n
        6. Additionally, you can also click "SHOW WORKING STATUS" to check current service condition (ENQUEUED: the service is waiting in the line for the next detection;
        RUNNING: the service is running and performing the detection or the geofence is working; CANCELLED: the service has been terminated by you; NOTHING: you have not
        define any service or the geofence triggering has been stopped).

    <string name="manual_guidance">
        This method totally rely on your habits of clicking on the buttons whenever you entering or leaving the target building, which is not easy for daily routines, so
        please only choose this method if you believe you can remember it and do not want your location or WiFi connection be exposed. \n \n
        In order to manually record the entering or leaving to determine user\'s presence, you need to follow several steps: \n \n
        1. Go to the configuration page by clicking the three dots on right-top corner. \n \n
        2. In the configuration page, you need the address of target building, which can be inputted manually (in such case, please make sure the inputs are right!!!) or

    </string-array>
    <string-array name="answer_list">
        <item>We have provided three methods in total. In general, the WiFi method is the most recommended one because it is simple and reliable.
    However, if there\'s no WiFi device installed in your target building or you simply do not want to use WiFi, the positioning method is a more versatile one which
    only requires the location service of your smart phone, but it is not as reliable as the previous one and may consume more battery. At last, there is always the
    manual one, but you need to manually click the check in/out button, which totally relies on your habit. The advantage of it is that it is very reliable and accurate.</item>
        <item>The core function of this app will exploit the feature of Android background work periodically in a long term, which may be affected and
    stopped due to battery optimization. In order to guarantee the continuity of the service to derive a reliable occupancy profile, it is mandatory to do it.</item>
        <item>First of all, the service will work for very long time in the background,
    which can be done only by all time permission. Secondly, both of the WiFi method and positioning
    method require location service to be turned on to access certain information.</item>
        <item>This totally depend on the specific device you are using since different manufacturers
    have their own customized Android system which limit the background service in different way. In general, the most
    common settings you need to vary are: all time positioning permission, battery optimization, background service allowance.</item>
        <item>There are several scenarios: permissions are not granted; background service is
    restricted; WiFi service is turned off; location service is turned off; you seldom use your phone.</item>
        <item>In most cases, it is suggested to select regular mode since it is lightweight
    and simple. If you are an expert or related personnel, the professional mode can help you to perform
    more actions remotely. However, it is totally up to you, the professional mode won\'t cost you more.</item>
        <item>SSID is the so-called service set identifier, which is simply the WiFi name
    while BSSID is basic service set identifier, which is a 48-bit label assigned by the router. They are
    both used to identify the router in the target building.</item>
        <item>Normally, it is suggested to follow the default ones, since they have higher
    accuracy and can cover most meaningful time period during a day. However, you can choose to customize
    based on your own behaviour. For instance, if you always work outside during the night, you need to
    change the stop time to a late time instance.</item>
        <item>You need to be an expert who works with our desktop software, in which you can retrieve the code for permission.
        Otherwise, even if you refer to professional mode, you can only access your own information.</item>
        <item>There are multiple reasons: your location service is turned off or failed, your device does not
        support the so-called geocoder function, your device does not support google service, your internet
        connection is off. In any case, if you cannot access the address and location, you can always manually
        input them. However, you need to make sure that the address is exactly as same as other occupants and
        the location including latitude and longitude has to be correct and precise.</item>

    <string name="question_1">Which method should I use for presence detection?</string>
    <string name="answer_1">We have provided three methods in total. In general, the WiFi method is the most recommended one because it is simple and reliable.
    However, if there\'s no WiFi device installed in your target building or you simply do not want to use WiFi, the positioning method is a more versatile one which
    only requires the location service of your smart phone, but it is not as reliable as the previous one and may consume more battery. At last, there is always the
    manual one, but you need to manually click the check in/out button, which totally relies on your habit. The advantage of it is that it is very reliable and accurate.</string>
    <string name="question_2">Why do I have to disable the battery optimization?</string>
    <string name="answer_2">The core function of this app will exploit the feature of Android background work periodically in a long term, which may be affected and
    stopped due to battery optimization. In order to guarantee the continuity of the service to derive a reliable occupancy profile, it is mandatory to do it.</string>
    <string name="question_3">Why do I have to grant the all time positioning permission?</string>
    <string name="answer_3">First of all, the service will work for very long time in the background,
    which can be done only by all time permission. Secondly, both of the WiFi method and positioning
    method require location service to be turned on to access certain information.</string>
    <string name="question_4">What device settings should I change?</string>
    <string name="answer_4">This totally depend on the specific device you are using since different manufacturers
    have their own customized Android system which limit the background service in different way. In general, the most
    common settings you need to vary are: all time positioning permission, battery optimization, background service allowance.</string>
    <string name="question_5">Why the app does not work properly?</string>
    <string name="answer_5">There are several scenarios: permissions are not granted; background service is
    restricted; WiFi service is turned off; location service is turned off; you seldom use your phone.</string>
    <string name="question_6">Which mode should I select, regular or professional?</string>
    <string name="answer_6">In most cases, it is suggested to select regular mode since it is lightweight
    and simple. If you are an expert or related personnel, the professional mode can help you to perform
    more actions remotely. However, it is totally up to you, the professional mode won\'t cost you more.</string>
    <string name="question_7">For WiFi checking method, what is SSID and BSSID?</string>
    <string name="answer_7">SSID is the so-called service set identifier, which is simply the WiFi name
    while BSSID is basic service set identifier, which is a 48-bit label assigned by the router. They are
    both used to identify the router in the target building.</string>
    <string name="question_8">What kind of time setting should I refer to?</string>
    <string name="answer_8">Normally, it is suggested to follow the default ones, since they have higher
    accuracy and can cover most meaningful time period during a day. However, you can choose to customize
    based on your own behaviour. For instance, if you always work outside during the night, you need to
    change the stop time to a late time instance.</string>
