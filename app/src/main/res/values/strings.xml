    <string name="introduction_text_main">
        Welcome to Smart Presence. The objective of this application is to detect your presence in target building and derive the building occupancy profile to help with
    your smart building management. In general, we provide three methods for you to choose: WiFi based method, positioning based method and manual method. \n \n
        WiFi based: the app will periodically compare the SSID (WiFi name) and BSSID (a unique ID assigned by the router) of your current WiFi connection with the target
    one configured by you so that you will be considered as being present if the they match. As a result, the app can derive the period of you staying or leaving the target
    building. \n \n
        Positioning based: the concept is that you will be considered as presence if you are within a certain range around the target building. In particular, the app can
    either periodically update your location with latitude and longitude to check your presence, which costs more battery or passively listen the location updates from other
    apps to trigger a geofence, which is less energy consumed. \n \n
        Manual method: you simply need to click the shortcuts provided by the app to check in or out anytime you entering or leaving the target building. It totally relies on
    your habits. \n \n
        We strongly suggest that before starting the services, go to setting page in which you can deal with your account, change the interval between two detections, change
    for what period during a day the service should work, determine whether to receive daily notification or not and change language. \n \n
        Finally, the app will work in the background and your data will be upload and stored in firestore database for further analysis.

    <string name="huawei_description">Huawei: even if you have disabled the battery optimization from the app, you still need to do it in your system setting page. Moreover,
    for older version of Huawei devices, the app works not perfectly due to intrinsic property of its customized Android system which significantly limit the background
    services, thus, please turn on the daily notification and re-start the service everyday or when you wakeup in the morning. However, for later version, due to the
    restriction of Google, the positioning based method does not work due to the fact that Google play service no longer supports Huawei.</string>
    <string name="samsung_description">Samsung: it does put some restrictions on background service so that please turn on the daily notification. On the other hand,
    you still need to manually grant the permission to run background service.</string>
    <string name="onePlus_description">OnePlus: you have to manually disable to battery optimization which cannot be stopped in the app for onePlus.</string>
    <string name="meizu_description">MEIZU: you need to go to the system setting page and find "privacy and security", in which you can enable the background running for

        In order to utilize the WiFi connection to detect user\'s presence, you need to follow several steps: \n \n
        1. Go to the configuration page by clicking the three dots on right-top corner. \n \n
        2. In the configuration page, you can generate SSID and BSSID of your current WiFi connection or manually input them (in such case, please make sure you are right!!!).
        You also need to decide the address which can be inputted manually or selected from a map. At last, you need to define what is the maximum occupancy of target building. \n \n
        3. Click on right-top corner to save your configuration and then come back to this page. \n \n
        4. Click "START" to start the service and then the service will run in the background automatically according to your settings. \n \n
        5. You can click "STOP" to terminate the service. The "START" button will become "RESTART" after clicking "START" so that you can restart your service whenever you want. \n \n
        6. Additionally, you can also click "SHOW WORKING STATUS" to check current service condition (ENQUEUED: the service is waiting in the line for the next detection;
        RUNNING: the service is running and performing the detection; CANCELLED: the service has been terminated by you; NOTHING: you have not define any service).

        In order to utilize the Google positioning service to detect user\'s presence, you need to follow several steps: \n \n
        1. Go to the configuration page by clicking the three dots on right-top corner. \n \n
        2. In the configuration page, you need the address and location (latitude and longitude) of target building, which can be inputted manually (in such case, please
        make sure the inputs are right!!!) or selected from a map. Moreover, you need to define what is the maximum occupancy of target building. At last, you can also choose to whether
        to disable battery saving mode or not. If you stick to default one without battery saving, the app will update location by itself periodically, which may cost more
        battery. On the other hand, if you change to battery saving mode, you won\'t have significant battery drop, however, the accuracy of detection is not good since the app
        will refer to so-called geofence which totally relies on the location update from other apps. We suggest that you can turn on the battery saving mode only when you
        often use apps which will require location service, e.g. Google Map. \n \n
        3. Click on right-top corner to save your configuration and then come back to this page. \n \n
        4. Click "START" to start the service and then the service will run in the background automatically according to your settings. \n \n
        5. You can click "STOP" to terminate the service. The "START" button will become "RESTART" after clicking "START" so that you can restart your service whenever you want. \n \n
        6. Additionally, you can also click "SHOW WORKING STATUS" to check current service condition (ENQUEUED: the service is waiting in the line for the next detection;
        RUNNING: the service is running and performing the detection or the geofence is working; CANCELLED: the service has been terminated by you; NOTHING: you have not
        define any service or the geofence triggering has been stopped).

    <string name="manual_guidance">
        This method totally rely on your habits of clicking on the buttons whenever you entering or leaving the target building, which is not easy for daily routines, so
        please only choose this method if you believe you can remember it and do not want your location or WiFi connection be exposed. \n \n
        In order to manually record the entering or leaving to determine user\'s presence, you need to follow several steps: \n \n
        1. Go to the configuration page by clicking the three dots on right-top corner. \n \n
        2. In the configuration page, you need the address of target building, which can be inputted manually (in such case, please make sure the inputs are right!!!) or
        selected from a map. Finally, you need to define what is the maximum occupancy of target building. \n \n
        3. Click on right-top corner to save your configuration and then come back to this page. \n \n
        4. Click "CHECK IN" to record your entering whenever you enter the target building and the data will be uploaded. \n \n
        5. Click "CHECK OUT" to record your leaving whenever you leave the target building and the data will be uploaded. \n \n
        Note that we provide shortcuts for these two buttons so that you can long-click on the icon of the app and then drag the shortcuts to somewhere convenient. As
        a result, you don\'t have to come to this page to check in or out every time.
